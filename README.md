# Neuron SDF Viewer

This is the repository for my first SDF playground.

## Quickstart

It's easy to start, but you'd better make sure that these dependencies ar installed:

- `Eigen3` for math
- `OpenCV` for display image

Then, enjoy it:

```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
../bin/NueronSdfViewer
```
